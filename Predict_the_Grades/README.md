### Project Overview

 This project includes logistic regression and random forest classifier as machine learning models. The main objective of this project is to predict the grades of the students using the data which includes various academic and personal characteristics along with final class grades so that the ministry of education for Portugal who want to chase an ambitious target of 100% completion rate for students in the country can identify at-risk students. With this, preventive actions at the right juncture can be taken if a student shows indicators of poor performance. 


### Learnings from the project

 I learnt how logistic regression and random forest classifier as machine learning models can be used in cases of prediction analysis.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The information provided made it easy to make assumptions and became less difficult for me to come up with the solution.


### Challenges faced

 Since this was the first time, it was a bit difficult for me to solve the project and get through it, but with GitHub's helpful environment, it became quite easy for me to overcome the challenge and hopefully will be in future as well.


### Additional pointers

 Challenges make you strong, keep going!
